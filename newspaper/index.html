She was created to be able to engage in meaningful conversation with people, she was created to look like Audrey  Hepburn. Dr. David Hanson, the founder of Hanson Robotics is known for creating robots that behave or act like humans. Dr. Hanson’s goal is to create humanoid robots that are smarter than humans with distinct human traits including the ability to learn creativity, empathy, and compassion. Sophia is Hanson Robotics latest and most advanced robot. Learn more <a href="http://www.hansonrobotics.com/robot/sophia/"> here </a></p></div>

    <div class = "col-3-3"> <h4>Brain Computer Interface & Telepathy</h4><p>Researchers have found ways of reading human brain activity or in other words your thoughts. A brain computer interface (BCI) can simulate telepathy by creating a brain to brain connection. The challenge of BCIs is putting information into the brain through a brain connection. However, some researchers believe they have mastered the challenge of inputting information into the brain.

    <div class = "col-3-4"><h4>What is Cloud Computing?</h4><p>Cloud computing is a phrase used to describe events where computer resources are transferred as a service over a computer network connection. A computer network connection is typically the internet. Therefore, cloud computing is a part of computer science that depends on sharing physical and virtual resources, instead of deploying hardware and software. A good analogy is the following, residents use electricity supplied by a power plant instead of running their own generator. So cloud computing is the shared computer resources supplied by the same hardware or software. Learn more<a href="http://www.interoute.com/cloud-article/what-cloud-computing"> here</a></p></div>
