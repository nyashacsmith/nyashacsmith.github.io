    <h2>Professional Summary</h2>
    <div class = "col2"> <p>I am a senior computer science major and I have an understanding of algorithmic thinking,
    problem solving, and software development. My passion for problem solving led to my interest in pursuing computer science.
    I love that computer science has applications in every field of study and that these applications spur rapid technological innovation.
    My commitment to computer science is demonstrated by my academic performance.
    After my first semester of college I made it onto Spelman College's Dean's List.
    I was also offered a summer information technology internship at Boeing and received The Google Anita Borg Memorial Scholarship for women in computer science. Furthermore, the fall semester of my sophomore year I was offered an opportunity to conduct undergraduate research under Dr. Yolanda Rankin.
    I pursued this research opportunity within human computer interaction and received the Clare Boothe Luce Research Fellowship.
    In the spring of my junior year of college I was selected to be a 2016 SMART (Science, Mathematics & Research for Transformation) scholarship recipient by United States Department of Defense;
    and I am excited to begin working for the United States Department of Defense as a software engineer post 2017 graduation.</p>
